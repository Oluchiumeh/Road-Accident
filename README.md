## Project Overview

This project entails analyzing road accident data using SQL queries and Excel to gain insights into accident trends, contributing factors, and geographical hotspots. By leveraging SQL for data manipulation and Excel for visualization, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights to transportation authorities and policymakers for improving road safety measures and reducing accident rates.

## Data Sources

The road accident dataset is available for public access through Kaggle website. Researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders interested in analyzing road safety trends and implementing targeted interventions are encouraged to utilize this valuable resource to promote safer road environments and reduce accident rates. The road accident dataset utilized in this analysis provides comprehensive information on vehicular accidents occurring across diffrent regions over a specified time period.

## Tools Used

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

- Purpose: SQL was employed for data manipulation, querying, and analysis of the road accident dataset.
  
- Functionality: SQL queries were utilized to preprocess and analyze the raw accident data, including data aggregation, filtering, Case statement and joining operations.
  
### Microsoft Excel
- Purpose: Microsoft Excel was utilized for data visualization, dashboard creation, and exploratory data analysis.
- Functionality: Excel's rich set of features, including pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting, were leveraged to visualize accident trends, create interactive dashboards, and present key findings from the analysis.

## Key Componets

- Data Collection: Obtained road accident datasets from Kaggle, containing information such as accident location, date and time, weather conditions, road type, and severity of injuries.

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the raw accident data using Microsoft Excel to handle missing values, standardize formats, and remove duplicates.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized SQL queries to conduct exploratory data analysis, including descriptive statistics and frequency distributions, to identify patterns and anomalies in the accident data.

- Trend Analysis: Used SQL queries to analyze temporal trends in accident frequency, severity, and causation factors over different time periods.

- Visualization: Created interactive dashboards and visualizations in Excel to present key findings from the analysis, including bar charts, line graphs, donut chat, and tree map.

## Results
- Identified high risk location like the urban areas and accident-prone areas such as the single carriageway which has the higest number of accidents, enabling targeted interventions and infrastructure improvements to enhance road safety.

- Discovered correlations between weather conditions, road characteristics, and accident severity, highlighting the importance of weather-aware driving practices and road maintenance.

- Generated actionable insights for transportation authorities and policymakers to implement evidence-based road safety initiatives, public awareness campaigns, and traffic management strategies.
